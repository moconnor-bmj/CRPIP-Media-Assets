CRPIP Media Assets

## This is a repository for testing various media assets, players and implementations for the (proposed) BMJ Research to Publication in particular (... and BMJ Learning more generally?). 

### As such this is a playground for testing out how content might be delivered to learners.

[The landing page](http://moconnor-bmj.github.io/CRPIP-Media-Assets/)  is simply a container for the raw media files which are available for download.

### Video:

[The video page](http://moconnor-bmj.github.io/CRPIP-Media-Assets/video.html)  contains a video player which captures some of the requirements for the Resrach to Publication product (specifically captions for translations). 

### Usage
1. Play the video
⋅⋅* Click on the 'CC' button
⋅⋅* Select your preferred language (dummy text is included on the captions for illustration)
